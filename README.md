# AndroidDevNDSCalculator
 
This android app is being designed for my (Gabriel) brother in order to better help him with his structural engineering for theatre sets. Currently he resorts to manually searching for values to implement in expansive equations. This app automatically pulls the values he is looking for and calculates the values he needs to assist in his drafting.

### About Us:
We are a small development team consisting of 4 people (Gabriel Soloman-Holland, Jacob Kapfer, Jacob Daleske, and Darren Ross). We have been consistently working on this application for Gabriel's brother to implement in his daily life. Our goal is to hopefully have an application that will help structural engineers do their jobs more consistently and quicker than before. This application is a quality of life application for structural engineers.

### About the Application:
The application that we have built uses a simple debug APK that looks through the files and finds code that is incorrect or that doesn't have all the parameters correct. This application has a minimum SDK of 21 (Lollipop) but we have been running the application on devices that are using the newest SDK 32. The application operates like this:

1. The user starts at the home screen where they can choose between going to the calculator that calculates the cases, the equations page which holds images of all the equations, or the tables page which holds certain values that the user may need to use.
2. On the calculator landing page, the user has a list that they can choose which scenario best fits their current problem. At the bottom is a custom case.
3. Once on the calculation page that best fits their problem, the user has a spinner that they can choose the type of wood they need and there is also a diagram showing what numbers they need to input. The page holds the values and there is a button to calculate. There is also another button that allows the user to choose between different sizes of wood.
4. The equations page is much simplier. There is a spinner for the user to use to select the case diagram they need to use. This has all the diagrams for the specific cases but custom cases are not present since they will be determined by the user.
5. The Tables page is very similiar to the equations page except that it shows values that the user may need.
6. Finally, on the main page, there is a legal information button that takes the user to information about the app, where some assets such as images came from and how to contact the application manager (Gabriel) if there are any concerns.
