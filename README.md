# AndroidDevNDSCalculator
 
This android app is being designed for my (Gabriel) brother in order to better help him with his structural engineering for theatre sets. Currently he resorts to manually searching for values to implement in expansive equations. This app automatically pulls the values he is looking for and calculates the values he needs to assist in his drafting.
